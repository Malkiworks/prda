## Question 2: Testing and Debugging (30 marks)

### Testing and Debugging Deliverables

#### 1. Test Case Documentation (5 marks) - `test_cases.md`
- **10 comprehensive test cases** covering:
  - Valid input testing (positive scenarios)
  - Invalid input testing (negative scenarios)
  - Edge case testing (boundary conditions)
  - Security testing (SQL injection prevention)
  - Error handling testing (non-existent users)

#### 2. Bug Identification and Analysis (5 marks) - `bug_documentation.md`
Three realistic bugs were introduced and documented:

**Bug #1: Logic Error - Incorrect Error Handling Redirect**
- **Location**: `app.py`, register route
- **Issue**: Redirects to home page on duplicate email instead of staying on form
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, lost form data

**Bug #2: Resource Management - Database Connection Leak**
- **Location**: `app.py`, update_profile route
- **Issue**: Database connection not properly closed in GET requests
- **Impact**: Memory leak, potential connection exhaustion

**Bug #3: Validation Inconsistency - Bio Field Limit Mismatch**
- **Location**: `app.py`, UserRegistrationForm class
- **Issue**: Bio validation allows 50 chars but error message says 500
- **Impact**: User confusion, inconsistent behavior

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following user table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER NOT NULL,
    bio TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Validation Rules

- **First Name**: Required, 2-50 characters
- **Last Name**: Required, 2-50 characters  
- **Email**: Required, valid email format, unique
- **Age**: Required, integer between 13-120
- **Bio**: Optional, maximum 500 characters

## Usage Guide

### Register a New User
1. Click "Register New User" from the home page
2. Fill out the registration form with your details
3. Submit the form to create your profile

### View User Profiles
1. From the home page, click "View Profile" on any user card
2. See detailed user information and statistics
3. Access edit functionality from the profile page

### Update Your Profile
1. Click "Edit Profile" from your profile page
2. Modify any information in the pre-filled form
3. Submit changes to update your profile

## Testing the Application

### Running Different Versions
- **Working Version**: `python app.py` (original working code)
- **Buggy Version**: `python app.py` (with 3 introduced bugs)
- **Fixed Version**: `python app_fixed.py` (all bugs resolved)

### Test Cases to Execute
1. **Valid Registration**: Test with proper data
2. **Invalid Email**: Test with malformed email
3. **Age Boundaries**: Test with ages 12, 13, 120, 121
4. **Duplicate Email**: Register same email twice
5. **Empty Fields**: Submit form with missing required fields
6. **Bio Length**: Test with 50, 500, and 501 characters
7. **Profile Update**: Test pre-loaded form functionality

10. **SQL Injection**: Test with malicious SQL input

## Security Features

- CSRF protection on all forms
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure session management
- Error handling without information disclosure

## Performance Considerations

- Database connection management
- Efficient query patterns

## Troubleshooting

**Database Issues:**
- The SQLite database is created automatically on first run
- If you encounter database errors, delete `users.db` and restart the application

**Dependency Issues:**
- Use the exact versions specified in `requirements.txt`
- Flask-WTF 1.2.1 and Werkzeug 2.3.7 are compatible versions

**Port Conflicts:**
- If port 5000 is in use, modify the `app.run()` call in `app.py` to use a different port
